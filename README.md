# fastText pre-built binaries

[Installing and building fastText](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText#building-fasttext-using-make-preferred) on a clean Ubuntu machine requires `make` which requires `apt-get` and a minute or so of computing time.

To make it fast and easy to use fastText on virtual machines programmatically, we have pre-built binaries for top platforms.

## Install

### Ubuntu
```
wget https://github.com/fasttext/build/raw/master/ubuntu-0.1.0.tar
tar -xvf ubuntu-0.1.0.tar
./fasttext
```
